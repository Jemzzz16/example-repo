# example-repo

This is just an example of cloning a repo and how to use git

NEVER CLONE A REPO INTO A REPO 

- git clone repo url

- modify / edit a file -> MAKE SURE YOU SAVE

- git add -A -> added the changed files to the staging area

- git commit -m "meaningful message about the commit" - update our local with changes

- git push origin main ->
- origin -> remote -> github
- main -> current branch we are working on 

- git status -> check staging and commited
